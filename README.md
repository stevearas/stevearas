### Welcome 

Though I've been a developer for 35 years, I'm new to GitHub.

I have several reasons for joining the community.

1. Work with my son as he explores a career as a developer.
2. Create applications that can help my other son, who is a non-verbal autistic 21 yo man.
3. Join a community where I may find happiness.
